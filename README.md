This course provides a solid introduction to the field of numerical analysis. The course starts with some basic discussion on some of the preliminary topics of numerical methods and provides a background of programming. Diverse methods of finding roots, interpolation techniques, numerical differentiation, and integration are covered in this course. The solution of ordinary differential equations and solving linear systems are also introduced in the course. Aside from developing competency in the topics and emphases listed above, the course aims to further development of the students in applying problem-solving skills through the introduction of numerical methods.

The objectives of this course are to
  -Develop an understanding of the core ideas and concepts of Numerical Methods.
  -Provide students with sound understanding and knowledge of programming and efficient coding to implement different numerical methods and concepts.
